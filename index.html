		The main motive of the project is to detect an accident the moment it takes place so that help can be sent as
		soon
		as possible.The concept is to use AI to tell if an accident has occurred or if a car has caught on fire.If any
		accident or fire is detected the program will send information to the authorities for requesting help.

				By leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow and Flask, we have created a dynamic web application. Our
				app
				analyzes videos, employing computer vision techniques to identify instances of vehicle fires and
				crashes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Our application serves as a powerful tool in enhancing safety and security within the transportation
				sector.
				With its real-time capabilities and accurate detection, it has the potential to save lives and minimize
				property
				damage.

				Our project encompasses and promotes several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting its
				profound
				societal impact and contribution to a sustainable future:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Goal 3: Good health and well-being
					</li>
					<li>
						Goal 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure
					</li>
					<li>
						Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production
